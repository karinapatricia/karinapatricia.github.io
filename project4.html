			<p><strong>User Interviews Notes</strong></p>
			<p>The Boys & Girls Club has approximately 24 clubs across the Atlanta area. Each club has 4-5 schools associated with it that the students at the school attend. The clubs bus students from schools to the club location, often with an average of 6-12 routes per day, in which each "route" consists of one trip to a school and back. These routes are carried out by buses owned by BGCMA, with capacities ranging from 14-50 students each.</p><br>

			<div class="content">
			  <p>From what we learned about how the club director at Harland B&G Club handles the bus attendance system and the registration, we noted:</p>
			  <p><strong>Making bus routes:</strong></p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li><p>Students register for the clubs from early August sometimes up till a few months after. A majority of applications happen in the first month or so of registration, but some students do register for the clubs on a rolling basis.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>When students are registered, the Club Director or Club Membership manager inputs their information into the BGCMA ETO database (more notes on this later on). The Club Director also keeps an Excel sheet for all students who asked to use the bus service. As students register, she adds who she can to bus routes, based on the school and grade they are in.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>Bus routes often fill up, so club directors must keep track of who wanted to be on the bus but couldn't get in.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>The club director then prints out a roster to give to bus drivers. This either has all routes on one page, or one route per page. The top heading is the name of the school/route (Ex: KIPP Harland K - 5, Thomas Jefferson Middle School). The first column is then the names of the students, the next 5 columns are the days of the week (Mon-Fri.).</p></li>
			  	<li><p>These rosters are then printed out and given to the bus drivers.</p></li><br>
			  	<center>
			  	<img src="images/Projects/Project 4/Frames/bus_roster.png" width="75%"/>
			  	</center><br>
			  	<li><p>The bus drivers return the rosters at the end of every week or month, and the club director stores them.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>This information is used if there is some safety incident and they need to confirm whether a student was on the bus or not, or to track missing students if they don't know what happened to them after they left the school.</p></li>
			  </ul>
			  <p><strong>Making bus routes:</strong></p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li><p>If a student appears to not be coming on the bus for a long time, then the club director may give that spot to someone else in the waiting list. It is difficult for the bus driver to keep track of this though, especially since the data is in paper form or Excel docs, and since the club director is already busy with a lot of other stuff.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>If a student is removed from the bus roster but then randomly shows up again, the club director would have to add in that student in pencil for at least while that roster is still in use. This creates complications with the bus driver since the bus driver can't check in a student not on a roster without calling the club director first.</p></li>
			  </ul>
			  <p><strong>Bus driver using the roster:</strong></p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li><p>They get paper rosters for the month or for each week from the club director for each school. They know the schools and how to get there.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>Once they get to the schools, they check students off by names as they enter the bus. They know some students better than others; depending on the bus driver, they may be more or less stringent in making sure each student says their name or the bus drivers just checking them off by memory.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>They check students off in the blank corresponding with the current day of the week and the student name. Sometimes the lists are alphabetized by student first name, sometimes not. It takes longer to complete check-in if they do not know most of the students on the bus.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>The roster is important because if there is a bus accident or something, the police would need to know every single student name on the bus.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>Once in a while, a student may try to enter the bus that wasn't originally on the roster. In this case, the bus driver must call the club with their own cell phone and ensure that that student is supposed to be on the bus. (Inclement weather, other situations may alter this process if the bus driver needs to get students on the bus fast.)</p></li>
			  	<li><p>The bus driver also may make notes on the bus roster for students that are misbehaving, need to sit in a certain place on the bus, etc.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>Once the bus arrives at the club, they need to make sure the students get into the club and checkin, so that the club knows exactly where each student is.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>Bus drivers pick up routes for other drivers, and maybe even for other clubs sometimes. The bus drivers we spoke to noted that other clubs sometimes another club they once worked at didn't have a roster at all, so they had to write down student names on a piece of paper.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>Bus drivers noted that they do not have much difficulty with the paper process the way it is, and noted that the bus drivers are not necessarily the most tech savvy always</p></li>
			  </ul>
			  <p><strong>Bus driver vehicle check up app:</strong></p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li><p>Bus drivers use this app on their phones in order to perform pre-checks and post-checks on their buses. This application/page format is why we decided to build a web-app, that could eventually be linked in this app.</p></li>
			  </ul>
			  <p><strong>Admin using the ETO:</strong></p>
			  <ul>
			  	<li><p>Clubs upload student data to the central ETO database during registration. This data comes from student registration to the club, not from the bus roster information.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>Admin does not have a central way to view bus attendance data for students. ETO stores club attendance data (students are scanned into the club by an ID or a barcode that the club houses), but ETO does not store bus attendance data.</p></li>
			  	<li><p>ETO has no ability to be changed from the outside. The only way to get data out is by downloading a CSV of the data. The only way to get data in is by directly uploading data to ETO. ETO stores all of student's essential information (name, DOB, school, grade, age, club, contact info, medical information, etc.)</p></li>
			  	<li><p>Admin cannot use the bus attendance data to optimize bus routes because it is still collected in paper form at the club level.</p></li>
			  </ul>
