				<!-- <p><strong>Description</strong><br> -->
				Fall 2020, I worked for Skiplinow.com (formerly Butidiners) as part-time UX Design intern. I was grateful to have been granted the opportunity to work as one of the first UX Designers before their name change!<br><br>

				Skiplinow.com is an Atlanta-based startup company that offers the most cost effective and innovative solutions to self-ordering, payment, and customer engagement for restaurants. When I had first started working there, they told me that their clients were often unclear on what features their product offers and I was tasked to redesign their website.<br><br>

				I learned a lot during this process from both the design and technical side. Working with a B2B service for restaurants, I had to consider both merchant and customer personas although their software is mainly operated by the merchants. I learned that there are also many constraints with implementation, what's feasible to code in a short time and responsive aspects of the website. I also got to work on the customer ordering experience and navigability of the online menu desktop template.<br><br>

				If you would like to learn more about the work I did at Skipli and my process, please feel free to <a href = "mailto: karina@gatech.edu">email me</a> or shoot a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karinapatricia/">LinkedIn</a>!<br><br>

				<i>Thank you Skipli for an amazing experience!</i>
